And a decade ago people like me were telling everyone if something doesn't get done about immigration then politicians will be forced to make harsher choices as the problem spirals out of control.

And lo and behold, we're now spending billions housing refugees in hotels which are laying off all their staff as they do so.

And decades and decades ago, instead of making harsh choices, it would simply have been a matter of limiting immigration and putting in place sensible policy.

But the sensible things weren't done when they obviously needed to be done, and now people like you are lamenting the ""anti-refugee BNP policies"" when we knew this was going to happen all along.

But successive government after government did nothing, they kicked the can down the road, the people who foresaw this problem and wanted to do something about it were called racists and bigots (see Gordon Brown's incident too) Labour on record as saying they wanted to ""rub the right's nose in diversity"".  And a decade ago, it was people like you calling us bigots and racists for pointing this out.

Well the joke's on them, because now they have to do the same things the Tories will do to appease voters and solve the problem, there are now no easy solutions to this problem anymore, only painful choices.

And here they sit, complaining that those things we warned about have begun to happen, despite the fact they did everything to stop a solution being put in place when it was needed.

No doubt they'd be happy if the government said ""fuck it, let's just have open door immigration"",  but then a year later those same people would turn around and ask me why the country is collapsing when we have hilariously high immigration and tragically low levels of housebuilding and public funding for infrastructure, transport, energy, etc.

""Research shows that the impacts of migration on wages and employment prospects for UK-born workers are small

Several studies have examined whether immigration leads to higher unemployment or lower wages among existing workers, and most have found either small or no effects.

In 2018, the Migration Advisory Committee reviewed the results of studies conducted between 2003 and 2018 and drew three conclusions. First, immigration had little or no impact on average employment or unemployment of existing workers. Second, where an impact was found, it was usually concentrated among certain groups – i.e. a negative effect for those with lower education and a positive effect for those with higher levels of education. And third, the impact may depend on the economic cycle; some—though not all—studies have found adverse effects on employment or unemployment, specifically during downturns.

Similarly, the MAC review concluded that immigration had had little impact on average wages, according to previous research. Some studies had found a small negative impact on average wages, while others found positive average effects.""

The failure to process claims in a timely manner, compounded by the failure to provide adequate planned accommodation for asylum seekers means they are more visible as they are being kept in hotels - often in town centres.

Having refugee camps in nearby countries that are designed from the start to develop into permanent settlements, funded by the international community.

The UK resettlement is much more official and less secretive so I doubt Rwandan officials will renege on it like they did with Israel. 

Obviously you can't stop people leaving Rwanda and paying smugglers to take them elsewhere, but it's unlikely they'd go through the risk and expense to return to the UK.

Australia ran offshore detention centres and push backs that dropped boat arrivals by 99%+ But the centres were in remote islands so expensive to run and they didn't automatically resettle (this is a key difference with the UK scheme) so many of those detained refused to leave and self harmed.  

So these schemes do seem to be expensive to setup and hard to get right but very effective at reducing arrivals. The problem with processing claims quickly is that it can't scale to meet ever increasing numbers. 

It's simply too difficult to assess real from fictional stories (many immigration lawyers help coach the fake stories) and physically deport someone who doesn't want to be found.

I suppose with this one you could go back to the 70's and argue our interference (this was a long time ago) brought about their rise, but to argue our past actions were solely responsible may be more of a stretch. 

Libya - this is possibly fair enough, but it doesn't make up a big portion of migrants, the numbers from here are very small.

Albania - not sure what argument you could make here 

Sudan - fleeing a civil war between military jaunta's, before that it was religious and ethnic persecution. Sanctions probably didnt help, but it was either that or support the genocidal government, we've never been involved militarily and we're going out of our way it seems to have nothing to do with the current conflict.

Iraq - Think I can see the argument for this one, however  at the same time when we never invaded I can't see Iraq being in much better of a place. Either a military strong man would remain in control and you'd still get refugees escaping said strong man, or they would be toppled and then you'd have the same ethic and religious civil wars we saw years after sadam was toppled, again causing refugees.

Eritrea - not really an area I have much understand at all of if I'm honest, but I can't see how wed factor in?

Yemen - this is another one I could give as our support for Saudi Arabia has prolonged the war. As far as I'm aware though Yemenis aren't making up a significant portion of the channel migrants.

So maybe I can get the argument that we should be held responsible for some of the migrants, namely Iraq, Yemen and Libya, but the latter two don't make up a noticeably sizable portion of the migrants anyway.

It’s understandable that many thousands wanted to leave, it was a bloodbath that you got caught up in just by going to the market. Again, a total failure by the West.

There are many ways to deal with this problem which are not purely impractical theatrics designed to rile up a certain section of the population and be cruel to those involved. For a start they could actually try processing some of claims of people arriving instead of leaving them for a few years before they are dealt with. This article from last year clearly shows where the problem is: https://freemovement.org.uk/asylum-backlog-hits-150000-and-net-migration-hits-500000/

While the number of arrivals has increased slightly, it's clear that the main problem is that the government have completely failed to keep up the applications. Incidentally, the approval rate for asylum applications is around 75% so the vast majority of people coming are actual refugees and not economic migrants, as the tory rhetoric would have you believe. Also asylum claims aren't as high as they were back in the early 2000s, and there weren't multi-year backlogs then.



I didn't say we should always reject what the majority thinks. I said that blindly following the majority is a bad idea, because what is popular is not always what is morally right, ethical or even reasonable. We have a representative democracy, which means the power to make decisions on behalf of the population is given to MPs. They are representatives, not delegates there only to dance to the tune of the crowd.

I also didn't say deportations are not necessary. In some cases they are, however offloading our problems on to third world countries with their own problems to get a few favourable headlines is completely ridiculous, not cost effective and will not solve the problem.

I strongly support electoral reform, but I don't want a direct form of PR. I want STV or something like it, because it means that everyone's vote counts, votes are not wasted in 'safe' seats, and MPs are actually accountable at every election. If the last few years have shown anything it's how dangerous naked populism can be. You get politicians saying whatever they think the mob wants to hear with no regard for whether it's a sensible course of action, whether its practical to implement or whether it is harmful to the country in the long run, all while misusing the power they have for their own purposes.

In part because they approve far to many people, that if they were assessed properly (and using the laws and methods 10-15 years ago) would be rejected. And yes, in the 2000's far more were deported...  So many claims are approved that in the past would never have been approved.

https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/asylum-seeker-charged-rape-skegness/ 



That's the kind of guys crossing the channel...  Can you see why people dont' want people like that  (and simply don't trust that you can assess people like that well enough to not accidently let someone like that in) ? You might go ""but not all of them are like that""... but some of them are (and in far larger proportion than normal uk residents/citizens). Would you personally want to live next to an asylum seeker camp, where they are free to go and come ? 

If we properly closed down the channel route, and had it closed for a few years, it's likely that there would be more appetite for more genuine asylum seekers being taken straight from location (instead of it being a lottery of who can cross the channel)





Who says it's blindly following? It's not blind, it's seeing that it has failed (here and in europe) and we can't just let everyone else, and that many of them are not good people.  I'd argue that parts of the left, that acts as you do, are completely blind to the realities on the ground. Instead of blindly rejecting the majority, maybe we should listen to them?





Ironic... considering that's exactly what countries are doing towards the west. Why is it okay for the third world, to offload their problems onto the west? 

But also it is not  in some cases, it's in vastly more cases. We need to be deporting far more than we are today. 

""Just process them"" won't solve the problem either, if you don't do loads of deportations, as it will just create even greater pull factor... and we cannot take everyone. 



Anything that drives result towards more proportionality, will do what I mentioned. Whether STV or MMP or PR. 

Populism  is what you get, if the left continues to ignore the immigration topic. There's a reason why it's better to actually deal with it, and not pretend it's not an issue. Same issues for ignoring things that fuel left wing nutty populists like Corbyn and SNP (The Independence movement is fully populist)

As France isn’t considered an active war zone, any refugees illegally travelling to the U.K. from here can be deported.

“Although it’s certainly true that crossing the Channel without authorisation isn’t a legal way to enter the UK, Article 31 of the UN Refugee Convention states that refugees cannot be penalised for entering the country illegally to claim asylum if they are “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened” provided they “present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence”.” 
So while it the Geneva Convention does not specifically say “Stop at the first safe country”, it does say that illegal migration from a safe country to another is prohibited and can result in deportation. 

“The short answer is that anyone is allowed to claim asylum anywhere, but states may lawfully remove asylum seekers to safe third countries on the grounds that they could have claimed asylum there.” - from this article that goes into it further.

Now you’re trying not to say that any of the several countries that refugees pass through on the way to the U.K. are unfit as English isn’t their primary language.

You can find English speakers anywhere you go really, even rural France.

Almost all applications for legal refugee status are approved.

10-03-23,"I don't get why this is such a big issue for some people. Seriously. What is not happening in your life that you've got to be so upset and emotional over whether a bunch of desperate people who you don't know get into the country or not?

This is not a political issue for me. It's a humanitarian issue. We got people in this country who are really struggling, and they're struggling because they don't have food, they don't have money, they don't have opportunities, they're struggling with disabilities, chronic illnesses, mental health issues, loneliness, addictions, lack of support, and so on. 

What is wrong with you that you've got to have such strong opinions over who gets into this country and who doesn't? Do you know any of these people personally? Are they affecting you personally in any way directly? 

My next point is how do you know what you're even talking about? Where are you getting your information? How do you know that information is reliable or even truthful? I mean, come on, let's be real here. Half of you keep going on about legal asylum seekers. There are no legal asylum seekers, because asylum seekers are travelling outside the law from a place where the law isn't being respected or applied, hence the need for asylum. But see when you go on about 'legal asylum seekers' you make it very clear you don't know what you're going on about. 

Same deal when it comes to 'genuine' asylum seekers. Who the fuck are you, internet stranger,  to determine whether anyone is genuine or not? What standard or metric are you using? And why would anyone accept what you're saying? Are you genuine? We've got civil servants, we've got lawyers, and see they know what's going on and you don't. Whoever told you we have uncontrolled immigration has lied to you. 

Instead of being all keyboard warrior over an issue you don't know anything about, you don't understand and you're not contributing anything meaningful or significant to, why not cut the crap and come out with the truth? You need to feel important and the reason you need to feel important is because you've done nothing with your life, achieved nothing apart from holding down a bum job, and need to feel that you're part of something bigger or greater than you. Only you lack the humanity and the empathy to actually connect to anyone or a community because you can only think about yourself and ""What's in it for me?"" 

This is the exact same issue as it was with austerity and people claiming benefits and stuff like disability. You're upset because the Government is helping someone else other than you and you're upset because this jars with your super-inflated sense of entitlement and imaginary grievances. But see you haven't done anything with your life that's worthy of any recognition from anyone and that's why all you can do is play at being some internet busybody and make your emotional baggage and psychological issues everybody else's issue. 

You cannot see how the Government and other politicians are playing you for a fool because you haven't done anything with your life, you have not matured either emotionally or intellectually. Life for you is still the same as it was in school, comprehensive school or even primary school, and you're still trying to be teacher's pet but you can't be teacher's pet because there's nothing special or extraordinary about you. You've done nothing with your life to be special or extraordinary, have you? You're just a willing, obedient puppet and automaton always willing to go along with what your corporate and political masters want for the sake of a few imaginary brownie points. 

Just wanted to point that out from the opposing side. See just as you hate people for no reason I actually love people for no reason and that's why I got tens of thousands of hours of experience of voluntary, charitable and community work experience behind me. I get a buzz out of seeing other people doing well or making significant, beneficial changes to their lives. It gives me a buzz when someone tells me they've got clean from heroin, I read people's first e-books, I go with disabled people to their PIP Tribunal in Holborn and see them get awarded PIP after years of misery and struggling. I help asylum seekers learn English.

We human beings all need each other. We all got to try and get along with each other. We all got to try and do something which makes a difference in the lives of other people because I've lived a life which has been rough and traumatic but see other people came through for me and made a difference. When someone does something for you, doesn't want anything back in return, because they're doing it out of their humanity and compassion, then it teaches you something and sometimes what it teaches you is something that is very profound about life and what life is really all about. 

You see in the end when we die and end up getting cremated all our ashes will look the same and weigh the same and it won't matter where we come from.

Because the number of migrants crossing the English Channel went from 300 in 2018 to 45,000 last year. That’s an increase of 149,000%. The largest group of people crossing the channel are now coming from Albania and abusing the U.K’s good natured refugee laws which are designed for people genuinely fleeing war zones and persecution. The only people who benefit are the scumbag human traffickers, who sell these people a lie when smuggling people into the U.K.

You say ‘who the fuck are you to decide who is a genuine asylum seeker’. Well, sure. So let’s look at what the people who make these assessments think; the French reject over 90% of asylum claims from Albania. We also know that Albania is not a warzone and is actually a relatively progressive democracy. So I think that’s enough to have a reasonable guess about what is going on here. 

People like you can bury your head in the sand, but if we created a migration system of ‘let’s let in everyone who comes from an economically underdeveloped part of the world and has had a hard life’ we’d be opening the doors to about 5+ billion people. That clearly is not going to work.",1191,0

I'll go a different route than the other commenters: to the UK itself, as a nation. To morals in general. To human decency.

When you answer ""we also have an obligation to have a fair and robust asylum system that doesn't demonise people fleeing persecution and doesn't use our sea borders as an excuse for refusing to process our fair share of applications."" by ""an obligation to whom"", I think you would benefit from placing yourself in a situation such as WW2. 

Now, yes, I know. WW2 comparisons differ in scope and scale. But imagine for a second trying to make the argument you're making here. When someone tells you that the jewish people trying to claim asylum in the UK ought to have a fair process, and that the UK has an obligation to provide just that, imagine if someone replied ""An obligation to whom? And who will enforce it?""

It's easy to forget that a lot of these asylum applications ARE legitimate. It's not all an abuse of the UK. There ARE people fleeing persecution by their government, grave bodily harm, sometimes even death, that seek refuge to the UK. They're real. They have a life, they have friends, and sometimes, when the system fails them, they die as a result. 

And it's a shame. 

Yes, the UK SHOULD make sure to distinguish legitimate asylum claims from people that want to abuse the system. The people disputing this are in the minority. But this does NOT have to be by shutting down all ways of making asylum claims. Because, like it or not, helping another human that is suffering isn't something that can be enforced onto you, but it IS the moral thing to do. At the scale of a nation, it means hearing asylum requests. It means providing for the poorest in your population. 

Imagine, again, being told that the government has an obligation to help the rough sleepers, and a minister ""who's gonna force us""? No one, that's who, no one but us and morals. 

I think your questions aren't the ones that should be asked. ""How can we distinguish between real and fake claims"", ""how can we end the backlog"", ""how can we make sure we do both this and keep taking care of our own population"", all valid questions. But ""who's gonna force us to do that""? I don't think you should ever need to ask this one.",2264,1

I think anyone who starts with “they should stay and fix” or “why are they seeking asylum HERE” should be attacked because sadly genocide is still happening in the world.  People are being persecuted for their religious beliefs, for their gender, for their sexuality.  And in plenty of places they’re punished by execution.

It may not be a Holocaust, but there are still plenty of people facing atrocious lives (if they get to live), and the only way for them to claim asylum legally is to somehow magic their way onto British soil.",685,1

It's something like 94% of Albanian refugees that do this, it's ridiculous.

So by processing claims faster you also prevent people from abusing the collapse of the system. If you're processing claims in weeks, not years, it's far easier to deport people and the cost to the gangs and the illegal economic migrants is such that it's not worth doing.

Looking at individual cases, of course one would say that this or that person is merely in search of a better life, why shouldn't they be given the right to move and live where they want? But in aggregate this would mean radical changes in demographics which can radically change and destabilise host societies, in ways which their settled populations emphatically don't want.

A sensible and legitimate approach is to find ways to accept people in ways that settled populations broadly agree with - and this should be absolutely possible. Most people do agree with taking in refugees or with giving shelter to the persecuted. 

The current system doesn't deliver: it is highly exploitable, actively leads to drownings at sea, is de facto ignored on the borders of southern and eastern Europe (and if the bill goes ahead, probably in the channel too at some point), lacks public support, enables migration but all too often fails at actually protecting the vulnerable, because as you point out attempts to try and work with the existing system have effectively led to the most vulnerable being frequently excluded from routes that would lead to their protection.

No, I already told you [*""Incompatible with the law"" and ""illegal"" are synonymous*](https://old.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/11nju3s/europes_far_right_praise_uks_illegal_migration/jbodbl7/). You don't get to go around telling me that your synonym is correct and my synonym is wrong based on nothing more than your own personal preferance.



Uh huh, and what about the ECHR? The court above the Supreme Court? The thing that was referenced in my quote by two MPs, who both seemed to think that this law wouldn't be possible to implement without leaving the ECHR? Can they make a ruling that a law is ""illegal""?",935,1
10-03-23,"
You actually haven't told me why they are not synonymous. I genuinely think that the phrase ""The wording of the proposed legislation isn't actually possible to implement legally."" is synonymous with ""The wording of the proposed legislation isn't legal."" and ""the wording is illegal."" Please just explain to me what each of the phrases mean and why they aren't synonymous.

Like ""killed"" can be a synonym for ""murdered"", and can also be a synonym for ""committed manslaughter"", but ""murder"" and ""manslaughtler"" are legally distinct crimes and are not words that can be used interchangeably in a conversation about law or crime. There's a few differences but normally murder means there was a deliberate intent to kill, wheras manslaughter charges mean there wasn't an intent to kill (perhaps there was only itent to harm, or perhaps there was no intent at all and it was entirely accidental).

Could you give me a similar explanation for the phrases being disputed in this converation please?

 

Hmm, just because something isn't easily enforced doesn't mean it's not illegal, I'm not convinced. Most people would say that it's ""illegal"" to ignore a court summons, yet people routinely ignore such summons - does that mean ignoring a court is legal now? What's the difference between a ruling from the ECHR, the Supreme Court, the local Magistrate's Court, and the Pirate's Code from the disney films? At what point does breaking rules, become breaking rulings, become breaking Legal Rulings, become breaking Laws, become Illegal?

Population (peak in 2040s, decline there onwards)

Old-Age dependency ratio (continually increases to 50% by 2070)
https://obr.uk/box/international-demographic-trends/

https://ifs.org.uk/publications/inequality-and-immigration

The OBR and IFS are all reputed impartial bodies


Once we hit 2040 the population will start to continually decline, but even before then-- as it is right now-- the average age and dependency ratio continues to increase.

This means fewer working age people to cover each retiree. This also means we will have fewer people to cover the same if not larger level of national debt that continues to rise, increasing the tax burden for each.

We must also looks the impact on our services-- even with the same % GDP dedicated, with less people the quality and size of our military will fall, rendering us less capable and able to defend our country, territories and interests. 

As the population ages we will have many more disproportionate consumers of healthcare, further making waits longer and shortages worse. This is exacerbated by low levels of migration leading to lower NHS staffing, and funding-wise a rising dependency ratio results in fewer people paying in whilst more people are taking out. This is only one service that will continue to decline at current estimates.

At current rates, in 2040 we could either accept thsi continual decline or require much more migration in a short period of time-- as we would have all the same issues today but worse, merely kicking the can down the road at best.

But waiting to change anything for decades then relies upon uncontrolled, ""stop-gap"" migration where we take in anyone who will plug the population gaps.

I prefer to consistently allow in net migrants of 220,00-240,000 today, which would allow us to slowly cope with changing dependency ratio and rising population which avoiding terminal population decline and continually rising dependency ratios

I would have all of this be skilled, legal migrants who speak the language. Encourage those who study at UK universities to continue here, and expand the skilled worker visa. However to make up the gap, where needed, we can also take in less skilled migrants-- especially in areas with shortages, such as construction and care-- who are also net fiscal and economic contributors and will ease the above issues.

We would accept only legitimate, legal refugees, which woud be around 15,000 or less a year after backlog cleared. We will be able to turn back everyone on boats using military interdiction if required in co-operation with France and set up claim processing facilities in embassies in France, out of the UK for legitimate asylum seekers to apply.

You think the strict and harsh protection of a nations borders is fascism?



A specific instance of one phrase, while unfortunate, is not sufficient evidence to call someone a fascist. Especially when the term has much more meaning than simply being a nazi phrase - it became a popular phrase amongst right wing/anti-postmodernists like Jordan Peterson and it's reasonable to assume that's the context she said it in. I think anyone reasonable would realise this. 



The use of dehumanising language is extremely unpleasant behaviour - but it is not identical with fascism. There are many ways in which people throughout history have dehumanised and otherised outgroups without it amounting to fascism. 

Fascism is an extreme ideology, and thusly requires extreme evidence.

Our day to day cost to public services is the same and lets say our tax contributions are the same, but my contribution is technically less due to my initial deficit. 

There is also the issue of children, migrants by and large have more children then natives and once they have a child or two those children effectively fall into the same bracket as the nationals due to the added cost of being raised. As per the report, nationals contribute a net negative so any migrant that has children should also have that considered when determining any net benefit/deficit

However house prices will stop increasing with a stable population, and supply will finally be able to catch up, especially with reform

Most importantly even if you dislike these stable levels of migration, its important to know the costs of the alternative. Countries like Korea and Japan are expected to reach a total dependency ratio near 1. Right now in Korea for example it is 0.3

Going to sound weird so ignore it if so, but its sorta like one of those partial derivative flow rates we do at school

In this case, there is a solution. There is a fixed number of migrants a year that will, assuming constant-ish birth and death rates-- allow us to maintain a constant population over time 

Or think of it another way-- there is a clear end point, immigrant up until the level where the younger generations are equal in size to the older ones.

Not bigger than, just equal to!
Not exponential growth needed-- we're just avoiding exponential decline.

Or do you want to hand other the Falklands because somehow the alternative means not having a nation





I don't want it to grow forever. I want it to be stable. We are currently expecting long run population decline



This isn't true-- see gov own forecasts-- and unless a ""stable"" birth rate is 2.1 you're calling for our country to eventually go extinct-- or at least continue to fall in population to irrelevance

2 reasons

1. Doesn't matter about everyone else-- at the very least we can use migration to slow decline and give up more time to properly adapt to continually falling population so that we don't have a continually falling quality of life, which is unsustainable
2. Not everyone is. Some in Asia (Pakistan) and especially Africa are predicted to have massive increases in population. Their GDP and so relevance will grow, until we are completely outclassed

If everyone were falling at same rate it wouldn't matter as much, but it's not. If  our population falls more we'll lose our current position and relevance. Worst case is Korea or China in 50 years-- screwed themselves over completely



If ""sustainable"" means the long term eradication of our country as birth rates keep falling. Unless you have a plan to permanently get birth rates to 2.1 or above, that's what you're dooming people to. Committing genocide against the people you claim to care about and weakening and their state and defence to the benefit of rising foreign powers in Africa and some areas in Asia or South America.

You have to stop thinking in ""sides"" man. If your roof caves in, do you segment your family into mums side and dads side? No, you fix the roof together, but that doesn't happen if you're sitting here thinking that mum actually enjoys having a caved in roof, coz ""fuck dad"". It's so asinine, but here we are with this actually being the case.

This isn't about red side or blue side or lib side or fash side. There is an issue here and the solutions being proposed by the government are terrible and sidestep the issue, others (not from any particular sides) are offering better solutions which the government is outright ignoring because it wants to keep the sides narrative going to prop up its domestic voterbase (culture war). The Tories have said numerous times they want to keep the culture war going, have you not been paying attention? Can you not see this is a part of those efforts?

Making asylum centres in France is not a lefty lib or far right solution, its a pragmatic step to not end, but reduce the number of people making trips to the UK.

Making centres in Calais does the following:

- keeps refugees in France while they wait for a decision, thus many won't get on boats, especially if they are successful.
- Makes boat trips less appealing, why get on a boat when I can just go to Calais and avoid drowning?
- Frees resources for our coast guard to monitor the reduced number of boat trips
- Gives us a valid excuse to come down hard on those who skip the centre and make the boat trip instead

The French want us to do, some in the UK want us to do it, the government doesn't and as some others have said, the crux feeling from the Tories is that they want there to 0 asylum seekers but can't say so and opening up a centre would mean accepting lots of genuine cases, which quite frankly they don't give a fuck about..

21-07-23,"Europe has not been welcoming to immigrants, as the right-wing authoritarianism and low emotional intelligence of the Europeans has led to xenophobia and racism in many parts of the continent. The influx of immigrants from Africa and the Middle East has been blamed by politicians for the economic and social problems of the countries, leading to further suspicion and lack of understanding towards those who come from different backgrounds. This has been especially true in areas with a high concentration of immigrants, as they are often seen as a threat to the current social order or as a strain on the already scarce resources. This has resulted in hostility between locals and newcomers, and the lack of acceptance has led to a feeling of isolation and alienation among many immigrants. A lack of understanding and support from the local community has also made it difficult for them to find jobs, housing, and other services. The lack of acceptance has also caused many immigrants to feel unsafe in their surroundings, leading to a further sense of insecurity and fear. It is therefore important for immigrants to recognize the importance of supporting their own economies instead of coming to Europe, as they will not only be able to find more acceptance and understanding in their home countries, but also have the opportunity to contribute to their economies and support their families.",1396,1

09-04-23,I would be against it even if every one of them were a well adjusted liberal minded brain surgeon. No people that wants to survive as a coherent ethno-cultural group would accept immigration (legal and illegal) at the levels seen since 1997. Both labour and Tory have enabled the colonisation and transformation of the population. There probably is no liberal democratic means available now that would produce a peaceful outcome. Places like France and Britain will polarise much like America. It will get ugly. You simply can’t have this level of immigration and cultural deconstruction (backed by the elites) and maintain a stable socio-political system,655,0

09-04-23,"Radical leftist liberal neanderthals are a threat to modern civilization and we all need to realize this. These so called asylum seekers are not in the UK because all of them are escaping war (war mind you they brought upon themselves). Many are radicalized and ticking time bombs. The Asian and African muslim population in the UK is increasing exponentially and so is poverty, unemployment, crime and religious violence. Is it mere coincidence that this is the very same ideological and religious views which trashed Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen etc? The very same which was exposed as being at the root of the UK rape gangs for example? Is it not logical to be weary of this? They however seem to be a protected species under liberal governments (at the expense of especially Christians and peoples of other faiths) and it's considered taboo to even speak the truth regarding Islam for fear of being labelled a racist or violent retaliation, because someone felt offended by the truth (all acceptable under the very deceptive and manipulating term islamaphobia which they use to their advantage). It's ludicrous. Do you think if the tables were turned, Saudi Arabia would allow UK citizens (more so Christian citizens) into their country as asylum seekers? Do you think they would allow them to demand churches, religious rights etc? The simple answer is no and that is a fact nobody can deny. In fact they destroy churches and temples of other religious faiths in the muslim world and nobody bats an eye. I am also in no way condoning any racist or violent behavior from any UK citizens, however it seems that the government isn't addressing the concerns of citizens and this will inevitably lead to frustration and desperation which leads to confrontation. The question people should be asking is who does the government you voted into power actually serve? You or foreign immigrants? I've got no sympathy for these so called asylum seekers (hypocrites) because I know exactly what their intentions are and trust me they don't benefit the citizens of your country. &quot;Smile outwardly with them while cursing them in your hearts.&quot; - This is what Islam truly is and what it thinks of anyone who isn't muslim. This is what is preached in mosques while people of other faiths or liberals aren't present and I dare anyone to challenge me regarding this.

21-07-23,"It has customisation abilities the hotel is less likely to be able to do. It looks like there are something like 250 to 300 rooms, each of which has at least 2 people. So 506 asylum seekers are an estimated figure which makes sense to that number of rooms, although some parts are the gym and classroom. Immediately, even though there are laptops in the footage, I can see where a small cost could improve something and at low power consumption. Each room could have a PiZero2 in it running IPFS for its quadcore blake2b hashing (connected by rj45 ethernet if possible) so they are all networked although some wifi usage could be alright to do in addition. This would allow for IPFS to provide largely creative commons and open source (although some other licenses like APache, GLPv2 or v3, and MIT and BSD and Government Public license) software (and backup for Soapy-Remote-server and Lime-Suite) and content like video (encoded in both HD like 1080p but also 240p which downloads much more quickly such as for preview of if you simply don't mind 240p)_ and then use the OpenCl1.2 driver on the GPU (when not video-audio encoding-decoding or modulating) for Gaussian functions and FFT (and spectral analysis like chebyshev polynomials) such as heatmaps but also, importantly for Software defined Radio licence training (British exam standard) because the signal FFTs and so on can all (or largely) be done on the GPU. The OpenCL driver is the same as for the 3b, and so is the firmware flash that allows you to boot from an external HDD (and yes, I do mean mechanical HDD for not just EXT4 and FAT32 partitions but also SWAP space, since the USB2 bandwidth would bottleneck a better HDD or SSD anyway so the wear and tear is better on a HDD). A low cost (2nd hand if need be) laptop HDD 2.5 inch sata-to-usb would be fine. It helps to use FAT32 because not only can swap space be cleverly created out of it but also it is used in BSD operating systems. Each USB tuner dongle (RTL-SDR v3 and the Nooelec NESDR SMArt) connected to the pi2zerow gets a 10Watt AMP antennae system via cooper coax, but can also book a timeslot to switch over to a shared 30Watt or 100Watt antennae system (booked on a class e.g. by ROTA or cronjob or bookings earned via points). Stick a few low cost satellite dishes atop the roof (they are say 25 to 50 used, and you'll mod the LNB and override the bias-tee anyway) and also allow to connect (by ROTA or timeslot booking via &quot;points earned&quot;) to the Es' Hail satellite transponder and use KU Band. They'd basically have the skills (apon getting a licence) of some GCSE maths and physics and potential for electronics training like high-pass-low-pass filters and Tri-state buffers (which make up multiplexers like for ADC, DAC). It is useful information for things like gaussian noise elimination but also microphone roll-off (top-end or bottom end or handling noise) in radio tech which for example is also useful in things like Sonar or Ultrasound (like for a bairn in a belly).It encourages the license and is a good prepping but it also means it is there as a radio tech for learning for younger generations (such as how sampling and synthesis are motivating to learn in demoscene). All signals (including spectral analysis and location and time-date data, MetOp HRPT and dish settings like Azimuth, Zenith, elevation, Look-Angles and so on), SSTV data, server logs, metadata and call-sign radio connections and chats are stored on the server (ipfs), along with transcripts by voice recognition and optional human-data-entry would stored in SRT subtitle files in many languages, as would equations and formulas in LaTex. Also NOAA band weather (maybe even images from Meteor-M LRPT) could be connected to and meterological maps and signal coverage could be made and then are owned as property under perhaps Government Public License and the public get it as a prepping, and the Asylum-seekers get a licence out of it (but also can communicate with people in other countries with a Software Defined Radio set-up). A small LCD screen and keyboard would go with the Pi and a battery as a backup so it charges. At most it would be a hundred nicker per Pizero2w &quot;kit&quot; (all in) and so for 250 rooms (remembering people shared) that is 25000 quids, and the value of the data alone exceeds that value. As an side the IPFS pi can also be used for creative commons or government Public Licence entertainment or edutainment or learning media. IPFS can be slow but on that network for humble data it would be alright enough to get by. This would strenghten the British Licence (a high standard). It is utilitarian and uplifting whilst a pragmatism opportunity.My comment has no hate in it and I do no harm. I am not appalled or afraid, boasting or envying or complaining... Just saying.

If these people are genuine asylum seekers and not just illegal economic migrants chancing their arm I have no problem accepting them as refugees into Europe, and I personally would have no problem with a barge full of genuinerefugees in my backyard. However, more widely, Europe in toto needs to seriously address the migration issue. I'm pro legal immigration and obviously pro helping out genuine asylum seekers. But we have borders in this world, for better or worse, and surely every country, everycountry has the right to determine exactlywho and who it does not admit. In the same way that every home-owner has a right to decide who to let into their house, Europe has this same right. As far as I can tell, most (the vast majority in fact) of the incoming migrants to Europe are simply economic migrants and unless they have specific skills they can contribute to a given country's economy or unless they are bona fide genuinerefugees fleeing life-threatening war/persecution, a strong message should be sent out that the doors will be locked when they arrive at Europe's house.",1414,0

From the US here, an outside person speaking, we all know how much these human people, these refugees from their other cultures and places are often vastly going to alter the very culture and moral values that you in Dorset are not in alignment with, just like in France right now and all over Europe. Yes these refugees are coming from war torn places, climate change is the biggest force as well, but the strong portion of these refugees that are causing such violence and dissent because their values do not align with the English peoples values, it is just unacceptable, especially since like we hear so much already, your own government like here in the US needs to vastly just respect, become more humane and serious towards its own peoples wellbeing. It is appalling often almost everywhere now, partly how climate change and corruption vastly exacerbating the collapse of our humanity, there Needs to be well thought out laws, deep discussions like is probably happening, but vastly more about whether you really want your own culture to actually shift and be altered, which always happens when a foreign people come into your environment. It is a real thing the vast difference of the muslim cultures values partly compared to western values and morals and as we are seeing, many of these refugees, like in France once they have become settled some deeply start to want their conservative values to be accepted into your culture, which are as we know vastly in some forms different and in deep disagreement to each other, why many of the refugees are disenting in France and causing so much harm to its people. Obviously there are violent supremacists who are natives to their own european countries, but our government vastly do need to speak to the inhumane and corrupt things that are already happening thoroughly at home, before we accept a whole new people into our space. If it was so simple, but we know it isnt, it is like taking care of ourselves first before we can really truly be conscious or able enough to really help other people too. But climate change and how this world is, is become a place where most everything that is sane and healthy is being altered, destroyed, compromised, jeopardized and conflicted further. But I vastly wish we could make serious boundaries and care for ourselves first the best we can. Even though that is far from how things are often. Damn. Thank you",2493,0

19-07-23,"It appears to me on the basis of questions such as &quot;why does it take so long&quot; thar there is quite a great deal of confusion,  or misunderstanding when it comes to what processing an asylum claim actually means. This isn't a situation where you fill in a form, some data entry clerk puts it into a computer and tada you're accepted or denied on the strength of that form. It isn't anything like applying for government services. These are migrants making an irregular border crossing, often without any identity documentation whatsoever. But they still need to be identified. You can't just take them at their word,  everything they claim has to be verified.  Genuine asylum claimants are coming from countries beset by war. Trying to talk to a government department in such a country to verify an identity under those circumstances is difficult at best. Even harder when they come from an undeveloped country that lacks such a department in the first place and doesn't track births/identities. That alone can take a lot of time and we've only just gotten to the name. Verifying identity is essential because you don't want war criminals, people escaping justice or illegal economic migrants pretending to be someone else. Indeed identity verification is so important it's covered in the refugees convention.  Then they have to verify that you actually came from the country you claim to have. This includes checking with other countries whether you've been granted refugee status there. Then you have to verify that the country is involved in a legally defined military conflict for the purpose of the convention. This isn't as simple as it might initially sound. One doesn't just turn on the news and see that someone with guns is fighting someone else. It's entirely possible for there to be a conflict in a country and it to not meet the legal definition under the convention. Defining it involves a whole lot of bureaucracy and legal advice. Or, you have to verify that the individual is part of a group inside a country being persecuted for a protected trait in a way which meets the convention. That too is a whole lot of bureaucracy and lawyers. This isn't just a person in a cubical making a decision unilaterally on each claim based on their own personal judgement.  There are interviews, cross department discussions, bilateral discussions with other countries, field work, the intelligence services can be involved in which case a claim has to wait for them to have time, there are all kinds of things that have to happen before a claim can be decided. They take time. Then, once a claim is decided a claimant has the right to challenge a decision and that whole process involves review, may require additional information gathering and ultimately regularly progresses into the courts. That takes time too. The ECHR has a ridiculous rule in it which is not part of the international convention that requires signatory nations to grant leave to stay to claimants whom have been denied asylum but can demonstrate they have developed community roots (a job, friendships, community participation such as volunteer work, time spent in the country, etc). It's a loophole in the system that economic migrants regularly exploit and is the main reason that so many asylum claimants volunteer for organisations directed at asylum claimants. This rule which the UK must follow so long as it's part of the ECHR gives the government incentive for claims to be processed as quickly as possible.  But it also gives incentive for illegal economic migrants to delay the processing of their claims as much as possible.  The longer they've been in country the higher the likelihood of being granted leave to stay despite not being granted refugee status. This is actually where the 88% figure on percentage of boat people being granted leave to stay comes from. If you look at the finer numbers,  number of boat people granted refugee status is just 13%. This isn't a situation where you could just issue a directive and make claims processing faster. It runs as fast as it can given the geopolitical environment we live in. What you could do is create a list of known economic migrant countries like the EU is doing and fast track those claims. But then you still have delays with appeals through the courts. You could take the right to appeal away but then you're stomping all over the UDHR, domestic laws and you'd have the UN involved.  The real solution is to send them to a third, undesirable country,  such as Rwanda and process their claims from there. This removes their right to appeal through the courts and prevents illegal economic migrants from having an opportunity to claim they have community roots. It still allows you to welcome genuine refugees and process their claims. Given the facility in the third country is owned and operated by the UK, with UK security,  they remain safe. But it deters unskilled or low skilled economic migrants from trying to hijack the asylum system to escape poverty. Poverty is not something you can claim asylum against and is not protected. Letting such migrants in doesn't just threaten the economy,  it's a type of colonialism because you're robbing the source countries of their best and brightest, the very people those countries need to end poverty and develop.",5520,0

08-03-23,"The United Kingdom has long benefited from the contributions of migrants. They have played a vital role in the country's economic growth, cultural diversity, and social progress. The UK needs migrants to fill critical skill shortages in sectors like healthcare, education, and technology. In addition, migrants make up a significant proportion of the UK's workforce, particularly in low-paid and low-skilled jobs.Immigration has also contributed significantly to the UK's cultural diversity. The country's vibrant food, music, and arts scene owe much to the contributions of migrants. Moreover, immigrants have helped to create a more tolerant and accepting society, which is essential for the country's continued progress.Attempts to stop immigration violate human rights. Migration is a fundamental right, enshrined in Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that ""everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state."" Preventing people from entering or leaving a country is a violation of their human rights, particularly if they are fleeing persecution, war, or poverty.Immigration policies that discriminate against specific groups also violate human rights. Any restrictions on immigration must be based on legitimate concerns, such as public health or security, and not on race, religion, or nationality.In conclusion, the UK needs migrants to sustain its economy, maintain its cultural diversity, and promote social progress. Any attempt to stop immigration violates human rights and undermines the UK's standing as a liberal democracy.",1681,1

This idea will open up more claims processing, more applications, larger backlogs, to a system that is soaking up billions of tax pounds that should be going to British public services and debt repayment.  The conservatives are exercising socialism for them and getting the working people to pay for their bungling mismanagement of fake asylum claims.  If illegal migrants come from Africa, Asia or the Middle East, you are traversing multiple time zones and countries to get to Britain.  They are ECONOMIC MIGRANTS.  All claims should be rejected immediately.  The law Rishi Sunak should have brought forward is one where anyone from outside Europe cannot claim Asylum.  IE: Africa, Asia and Islam should be forced to deal with their overpopulation and exponential population growth, 4 or 5 times that of Europe.  No one gets in, not even legal migrants.  If you've read this far, then it is worth pointing out that the future is troubling;  climate collapse, widespread food, jobs, housing and energy security.  As the climate worsens, it will trigger prolonged inflationary pressures, driving up the cost of foreign imports increasing food insecurity.  Don't be fooled by Capitalist smooth talkers.    Because of this,  Britain, Germany and America are in the top 4 migrant countries.  Capitalist growth ideology will fail Britain.  Channel 4 needs to raise the debate.  Westminster politicians are failing to promote a sustainable Britain in a climate constrained world. UK and European politicians are taking Europe down the primrose path to collapse.  They are too feeble minded to take the tough decisions.  Tony Abott (Australia) made the tough decisions.  Whilst he is not one my list of favourite politicians, he successfully forced migrant crossing back to Indonesian beaches in Java .  The boats stopped coming.  Britain and Europe should capture and deport them back to African and Middle East beaches.   Continued legal and illegal migration will turning Britain and Europe into a failed state.

Year after year the most ridiculous scuffbags come to the UK and is allowed the opportunity to live and work here, but the reality is they don't make nowhere near enough a contribution this country to warrant them staying here for long periods of time or indefinitely and it's about time that the government put's a stop to this as well, if they truly care about the country. I don't care they didn't come here in a dinghy across the channel, if the migrants crossing the channel are deemed absolutely worthless, then so should these people because the truth is they are! The only thing these people care about is themselves and making sure their able to settle here in housing or work for their own benefit and this can't be allowed to happen anymore! As for the channel crossings, the Rwanda scheme won't work. It will be met with fierce resistance with claims that it's inhumane, which is because it is. But the people who are still backing it clearly don't care it's inhumane, or that it's very expensive. In terms of deterring others to cross the channel it's not working and won't work even if the government does manage to successfully send dozens of plane to Rwanda. And reasons for this include the fact we as a country willing accept large numbers of immigrants to the UK every year, the people running the smuggling business most likely tells their 'customers' this a source of encouragement to jump on a dinghy to get a better life, and any of them with fears about the travel will know of all the successful people who accomplished getting into the UK are living better lives.For the government to be able to really get to grips with the people smugglers they need to put more funds in the crime agencies and as for stopping the people themselves from leaving their countries, they need to look into ways to sort out the issues in the countries where the migrants are coming from. It would have to be done as collective with other countries, such as France for example, but the pains will be worth it achieves the prize of actively preventing people from planning to make journeys to illegally travel to other countries. It wouldn't done in a way that whatever countries that has clear problems that's driving out it's citizens is ASKED to deal with them because the effects of them are spreading to other countries, it would have to be done in a way where their being TOLD to fix them.",2737,1

Personally I dont care, they (The migrants, not the tory scum) can rent my house and have my job. I want to leave the UK. Realistically, I can see why people are upset, even I feel ill will sometimes, when i see someone, presumably a foreigner, who might have a better job, or be having a better time, or driving a car, all things i'm stuggling to do (find a decent paying job or get a drivers licence is not easy for me here - I have a house because my mum died and left me the family home - if i didnt have that i'd be on the streets). The migrants are not the problem though, its the goverment. We can accept some people, we just need to keep track of everyone. We also need to send some people back, and to do that, we need to implement infrastructure abroad, so that people can have access to jobs and resources in their home countries, or be relocated elsewhere. This requires diplomacy on a global scale, and Brexit has pissed off our closest neighbours. Have they not been interviewing these refugees and trying to get info from them about these traffickers? Illegal migration would be less of a problem if things were alright for citizens. However I work full time, i'm looking for a 2nd job, but I cant find a decent living wage in the UK, or a good work to life balance. I hate living here, and will leave once I have my skilled building trade, driver licence and science A levels. Ill go to europe first, through asia and africa, and eventually get to the pacific and go to the Americas from there. I find very little opportunity here, but for people coming from warzones its probably ok. Some of these migrants are literally dying to get here, and will work and be grateful to be here. So i dont actually have a problem with migrants. We just need to crack down on the traffickers (surely you could send someone in undercover), make note of everyone arriving, prioritise families and women and children, but honestly just go by, case by case, and gather information on every refugee. Then test them for job skills, family connections, and requirements (where will they stay, how will they communicate, work, survive? etc). I'm sure this is all being done, but as evidenced by the graph earlier in the video, over the past 10 years of tory scum rule, migration has increased 10 fold. So, whats up with that? The UK has always been afraid of immigrants, so why are the numbers skyrocketing under the tories now? Its to intentionally make it an issue, because they know it riles up the working classes (citizens struggling to make a living), and it distracts everyone from getting to the real cause of problems in this country, that being the tory scum c*nts.",2898,0

Under international law they have a right to claim asylum if they do so at the first opportunity that they enter the country regardless of how they enter.Introducing the proposed bill will be a breach of international law.The journalists need to point this out rather than allowing the Conservatives to continually lie.This MP also appeared to criticse internationally recognised human rights legislation.Also what is wrong with having a second referendum of EU membership? Opposing a second referendum is not democratic.  This MP is anti democracy and anti human rights. The Conservative Party are creeping towards fascism.,710,1

You could have said ""some voters...."" to make the claim in a politically neutral manner. I know some Labour voters who do not support the practice.In terms of why your argument is a strawman, it is because it asserts that a claim is widely made when in fact it is rarely or never made.I have never heard anyone mainstream say ""Asylum seekers should not stay in nice hotels because they are asylum seekers not UK citizens"". What is being said (as I understand it) is ""Asylum seekers should not stay in nice hotels at no financial cost to themselves when I as a worker or pensioner can't afford to stay in a nice hotel and am not given any subsidy by the government to do so"". That is a completely different viewpoint, and one that cannot be dismissed so easily if we are genuinely committed to equality.I have also heard an argument in some communities that the hotel function areas have been used by locals for wedding receptions, 21st birthday parties,  50th wedding anniversary parties for a long time and that there is no other alternative local venue for these functions.  The Govt in taking over the hotels for asylum seekers also closes the function rooms and sometimes the restaurant, this depriving the community of access to the facility.Here the argument is not 'Asylum seekers should not be in nice hotels"" as you falsely claim but is ""This local hotel has some nice facilities that the community has used for a number of years.

So a Dane decides to flee up through Sweden, then Finland, then Russia, then North Korea, then South Korea and then finally taking a boat to Japan, to seek asylum there. Why?

Britain was once invaded by 7000 people in 1066 and this is way beyond that number now so yeah it's a problem that poses many potential other problems no matter how people try to dress it up. And is it really just the sight of immigrants ; the thought of them staying in Nice hotels that upsets people which is what this low test bloke says? Or is it the fact 6-7 million a day of their tax payer money which alot of is spent on many who aren't legitimate refugees and have no required skills and no intention of respecting/conforming to local values ; laws or even contributing to society during a cost of living crisis, let alone the fact many come from or pass through safe countries. Could that be more the issue? For example not everyone has the well financed upbringing that this geek has in order to study computers to such a high degree and therefore the £39 a day which comes out of our paid taxpayer money which goes to many who don't deserve it along with free accommodation in a swanky hotel creating a better life than many British have in their own country.Now I don't know one person who would ever be upset about their tax payer money aiding legitimate refugees or welcoming ; supporting people who respect the culture/law and was looking to contribute with their skills and hard work and pay their way in time but not to acknowledge the people who are taking advantage of the British good nature and or have criminal intent or past and also the local people it effects when they lose their hotel jobs each time the government take over a hotel and the community impact/consequences that's has is very very poor centrist reporting.

France Germany etc speak it quite well. Aside from the fact they can barely speak a word of the language which kinda blows that argument out of the water.3. They have been seen by both coastguard and other rescue ships dumping any identification documents overboard. They could literally claim to be anyone from anywhere. 4. As many have also pointed out they pass through many safe 1st world countries despite the fact those countries have a proven record of welcoming and treating well refugees, particularly Germany. Now why on earth would they pass up these countries and travel through the entirety of Europe to get to the UK? If the UK was literally the only destination they could reach then maybe they could be considered genuine asylum seekers. But simple fact is they are economic migrants. They get accommodation and pocket money while here. If they must stay at least make it compulsory for the physically healthy to contribute in some way to society. Farm or factory work etc for a fair wage least thst way they are earning honestly. Give them classes on British customs and values so they can socially integrate",1542,0

09-04-23,"The Channel 4 perspective. The amount of times “Far Right” is slipped into the narrative is interesting.  People in the UK want to be safe. The law abiding people of the UK and other European nations have a right to feel safe within their own country. So many of the illegal migrants destroy their documents so that they cannot be traced. Then there have been atrocities such as the Manchester Arena bombing. By a supposed asylum seeker. There are people who have entered Britain from safe countries where they could have claimed  asylum. They are mostly young fighting-age men who could help to rebuild  their own countries. What is worrying is the ones that have slipped in under false pretences bringing their extremist religious beliefs with them. One suicide bomb can kill many, one fanatic, or a small band can create carnage.  Every entrant to the UK needs to be validated by passports, just as UK citizens are when travelling abroad. The UK needs to protect its borders and keep illegal entrants out. If one illegal is up to no good it can affect many British people. The people opposed to open borders for illegals are not “Far Right” - they are ordinary people trying to keep their country, community and kids safe. The smear of  “Far Right” is used by the socialists, communists and Marxist/Stalinists who celebrated and got merry in the same bier Kellers of Munich with the National Socialists of Germany in the 1930s. Both sought to eradicate democracy and capitalism. They are still busy at it today. Look at Russia, look at China. But some people in safe , free democracies would rather autocracy  and dictatorship.  Who are sending people over the Channel in boats? Criminal gangs, traffickers, people traffickers, drug traffickers, arms traffickers, terrorist traffickers, Probably the Wagner Group,the Belarus dictator, Putin - maybe even China. What do they want to do? Undermine the West, undermine and destroy democracy and freedom to have free reign as autocrats over a totalitarian controlled World. Undocumented illegal migrants is just part of their strategy to destabilise democratic nations. No one entering the UK should have nothing to hide. If they are hiding who they are they are probably up to no good. No passport, no entry. Illegally entering the UK is actually ILLEGAL. Set up courts/tribunals at ports and points of entry. Question: Do you have a passport?  Answer: No. Court/tribunal response “ Then you have no valid reason to be in this country and you will be removed”.  The EU is handling the situation badly and so- called NGOs working hand-in hand with traffickers is not helping. The UK really does not need countless young men  unknown, unaccountable and un-identifiable  wandering its streets .",2741,0

08-04-23,"The UK should be concerned, just look at what happened in Sweden and Italy. These aren’t boat “rescues” or just “asylum seekers”, this is open borders that have consequences. What are those consequences? Let’s take a look at Italy’s crîme stats.Foreigners make up 8.7 percent of the Italy’s population, yet commit over half of all serious crimes. A whopping 89.7 percent of crimes involving exploitation of prostitution, 55.8 percent of cases involving sexual violence, 52.8 percent of robberies, 52.4 percent of thefts, and 43.6 percent of malicious injury cases. Keep in mind, the data does not include crimes committed by second-generation Italians. In other words, Italians born to immigrant parents are not listed as “foreigners” and are instead seen as Italian citizens. If you add them, it’s over 80% of the seríous crimes in Italy. The data helps dispel the notion that immigrants coming in are all just peaceful people looking for a better life. The data shows that foreigners account for a massively disproportionate share of the overall crime rate.“the worrying cultural climate in which certain phenomena occur is a sign of a total lack of any kind of values”. - Chief Inspector Omar Di RoncoAfter a week of widespread chaos breakout n Italian lakeside towns near Lake Garda involving up to 2,000 migrants. The chaos included widespread violence, stabbings and assaults. The Italian public prosecutor’s office and the Italian Parliament have opened a number of investigations, including into cases where migrant men sexually assaulted teen girls, including 6 on a train from Lake Garda to Milan. “They are just a culture of criminals who have left a deep wound in my community. We lived a week of war,” said the mayor of Italian lakeside town PeschieraStats aren’t “racîst” or “facïst”, they’re just stats and anyone that uses those ad hominem attacks are just trying to silence people from telling the truth.

A deportation order is made for a person who is not British citizen who has been convicted in the UK for an offence and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months.Further, quoting from a government website: ""Entering the UK illegally prevents law enforcement from conducting criminal record or security checks, meaning we don't know who they are or what risk they pose to the UK.""

I have genuine concerns about the asylum seekers which now won’t be taken seriously because of how this is edited for one and two because the far right have definitely manipulated the people of my town. I never attended this protest due to the fact that I knew I wouldn’t agree with either side of the protest. One side whilst having legitimate concerns about who is being brought in to our community is racially charged, you can see that in the comments people make about them on that Facebook page shown in this video (I joined that group when I moved to the area). The counter side to that protest are those who think we should have an open broder and let everyone in and then ask questions later. The sad thing for me is that two women who might have legitimate concerns initially have obviously been duped by a far right group with the offer of help and support for organising and legitimising the protest. Which if you’ve never seen anything about how these nationalist groups recruit and spread their message is exactly how they operate. Ultimately I have a child on the way and I want to know that the people being allowed into my community are there for the right reasons, I have no problem with refugees I can’t imagine what it is like having to flee for your life to escape war and persecution but like with everything in life there will be people coming here for the wrong reasons. There should be a better system to check who is coming in to our country but there should also be better education so people like the two ladies sat on the bench with no teeth don’t accidentally help spread right wing nationalism without having a clue what they’re doing.

It's the actions of the capitalist system to destroy all competition and force everyone to work for them and buy off them and who destroy their countries economy and create areas where employment is no longer viable just to prevent that country from competing with the west. It's the fermenting and destabilising actions of the MI6 and CIA in other people's countries that's destroying their economics and forcing their people to emigrate to the west. Their whole survival is dependent upon members of their families and communities finding gainful employment in other countries who are often the causes of their plight in the first place. Another obvious reason for creating the asylum seeker issue is the despicable conservatives who wanted to water down our human rights so it can force itself upon us.,1212,1
